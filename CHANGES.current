            module was loaded at a time when data is being shared between modules.

            [Java] Patch #168 - Fix leak in Java director string handling after the Java
            upcall when called from a native thread.

	    release.

            [Python] Add patch from Thomas Maslach to fix crash in wrappers when using -threads in

            [C#] Merge patch #229 from contre - Add bool array types to arrays_csharp.i

	    [PHP] Add support for specifying any PHP interfaces a wrapped class
	    implements, e.g.: %typemap("phpinterfaces") MyIterator "Iterator";

2014-09-11: olly
	    [PHP] Fix throwing a PHP exception through C++ from a subclassed
	    director method - PHP NULL gets returned by the subclassed method
	    in this case, so the directorout typemap needs to allow that (at
	    least if an exception is active).

2014-09-09: ianlancetaylor
	    [Go] Add goargout typemap.

2014-09-09: olly
	    [PHP] Fix segmentation faults with directors in PHP >= 5.4, and
	    reenable runme tests for director_basic testcase.  Fix from
	    pavel-charvat in issue#164.

2014-09-05: ianlancetaylor
	    [Go] Add imtype, goin, goout, godirectorin, and
	    godirectorout typemaps, to support writing Go code to
	    convert between types.

2014-09-02: olly
	    [Python] Fix regression in indentation of python code produced with
	    -modern, introduced by changes in #188.  Reported by fabiencastan
	    in #218.

2014-09-01: olly
	    Issue an error for unknown SWIG preprocessor directives, rather
	    than quietly ignoring them.  Reported by jrhelsey in issue#217.

2014-08-23: richie765
            [Javascript] Added support for a variety of V8 versions

2014-08-15: talby
            [Perl] Include guard fix for nested modules from Anthony Heading (SF Patch #350).

2014-08-04: wsfulton
            [C#] Merge patch #200 from gpetrou - Changed CSharp license header to include auto-generated
            tag so that StyleCop ignores the files.

2014-08-04: wsfulton
            [Java] Merge patch #198 from Yuval Kashtan - Support for java.nio.ByteBuffer mapping to 
            unsigned char * in various.i in NIOBUFFER typemaps.

2014-07-14: ianlancetaylor
	    [Go] Change struct definition to use void *, not uint8, so
	    that the type is recorded as possibly containing
	    pointers.  This ensures that the 1.3 garbage collector
	    does not collect pointers passed to C++ code.

2014-07-01: wsfulton
            Fix SF Bug #1375 - Expansion of the $parentclassname special variable incorrectly contains 
            brackets in the expanded name.
